# GeographicLib
This is a .NET/C# port of GeographicLib (https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/) - A library of classes to geographic, UTM, UPS, MGRS, geocentric, and local cartesian coordinates, for gravity (e.g., EGM2008), geoid height, and geomagnetic field (e.g., WMM2010) calculations, and for solving geodesic problems. The original library, written by C. F. F. Karney, is in C++ and while there is an existing .NET wrapper, this is a pure C# port of the original. This library is released under the MIT/X11 license (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
